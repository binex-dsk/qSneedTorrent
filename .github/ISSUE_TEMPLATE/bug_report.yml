        #### ADVISORY
        "We do not support any versions older than the current release series"

        "We do not support any 3rd party/forked versions e.g. `portableapps`/`Enhanced Edition`etc."

        "Please post all details in **English**."

        #### Prerequisites before submitting an issue!
        - Read the issue reporting section in the **[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)**, to know how to submit a good bug report with the required information.
        - Verify that the issue is not fixed and is reproducible in the **[latest official qSneedTorrent version](https://www.qsneedtorrent.org/download.php).**
        - (Optional, but recommended) Verify that the issue is not fixed and is reproducible in the latest CI (**[macOS](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/actions/workflows/ci_macos.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)** / **[Ubuntu](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/actions/workflows/ci_ubuntu.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)** / **[Windows](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/actions/workflows/ci_windows.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)**) builds.
        - Check the **[frequent/common issues list](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/projects/2)** and perform a **[search of the issue tracker (including closed ones)](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/issues)** to avoid posting a duplicate.
        - Make sure this is not a support request or question, both of which are better suited for either the **[discussions section](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/discussions)**, **[forum](https://qbforums.shiki.hu/)**, or **[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/qSneedTorrent/)**.
        - Verify that the **[wiki](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/wiki)** did not contain a suitable solution either.
        - If relevant to issue/when asked, the qSneedTorrent preferences file, qSneedTorrent.log & watched_folders.json (if using "Watched Folders" feature) must be provided.
          See **[Where does qSneedTorrent save its settings?](https://github.com/qsneedtorrent/qSneedTorrent/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#Where_does_qSneedTorrent_save_its_settings)**
